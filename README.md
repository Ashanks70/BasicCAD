[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0d70f655203ca304cb3c5b7d/w/f55603f962f6fc74f5548a68/e/41d730c570a8d75fce9f51b6)

### My Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and following along with Dr. Shields made is super easy.  I learned about 
** sketching
** constructions lines
** dimensions
** extruding (add and remove)
** linear patterns

Onshape is awesome.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
