We are creating a caster.

## Base

### The Assignment

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0d70f655203ca304cb3c5b7d/w/f55603f962f6fc74f5548a68/e/41d730c570a8d75fce9f51b6)

### My Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and following along with Dr. Shields made is super easy.  I learned about 
* sketching
* constructions lines shortcut key is **Q**
* dimensions shortcut **D**
* extruding (add and remove) shortcut key **E**
* linear patterns

Onshape is awesome.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
